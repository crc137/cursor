## Getting Started

Installing Cursor on Linux is quick and simple:

1. **Download the installer** from the official website.  
2. **Make it executable** (one-time action).  
3. **Run the script** – it will automatically fetch the latest AppImage, integrate Cursor into your application menu, and add the `cursor` command to your terminal.  

> ⚡ On first launch, the installer will check for and install any missing dependencies (`curl`, `jq`, `zenity`).  

### Launching Cursor
- From your application menu (search for **Cursor**).  
- From the terminal: `cursor`  

### Updating
Cursor automatically checks for new versions. If an update is available, you’ll receive a graphical notification and can upgrade with just a couple of clicks.  

### Uninstalling
To remove Cursor, simply run the installer with the `uninstall` argument – it will completely clean up the AppImage, icon, and all related settings.
